# Week 02 - Data Types & Operators

Welcome to Week 02, Wednesday Session 02!

Thanks to a public Holiday, we didn't get to do Monday's session.

Hence we'll be covering a fair bit tonight.

In JavaScript, we has several different data types. If you're a student, you must understand them before you can become good at the language. Let's
go through each data type, especially the concept of the Boolean (true or false) arguement.

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Strings

-   A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like `John Doe`
-   Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
-   For example:

    ```js
    // Using double quotes:
    let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

    // Using single quotes:
    let carName2 = "Volvo XC60";
    ```

-   You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

-   For Example: You can double quotes insides single quotes,  or single quotes inside double quotes:

    ```js
    // Single quote inside double quotes:
    let answer1 = "It's alright";

    // Single quotes inside double quotes:
    let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

    // Double quotes inside single quotes:
    let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Numbers

-   All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
-   Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
-   For example: The following statements are equivalent in JavaScript:

    ```js
    // With decimals:
    let x1 = 34.0;

    // Without decimals:
    let x2 = 34;
    ```

    ### Exponential Notation

    Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:

    A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - \* / ):

    For example:

    ```js
    let y = 123e5; // 12300000
    let z = 123e-5; // 0.00123 
    ```
    
    ### the JavaScript Big Integer

    By default,  all JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.

    However, a new datatype (ES2020) was recently introduced which can be used to store integer values that are
    too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

    For example:

    ```js
    let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
    ```
    





## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Booleans

-   Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
-   Booleans are super important to understand in the logic of passing an argument. For example, is a password entered true or false? In the example of tasks an incomplete task is considered false and a complete task is considered true.

    For example:

    ```js
    let x = 5;
    let y = 5;
    let z = 6;
    if (x == y) {return true}  
    if (x == z) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    } 

    ```



## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Arrays


-   Without exception, JavaScript arrays are ALWAYS written with square brackets.
-   Array items are separated by commas
-   The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):
    

    ```js
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Objects

-   JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
-   Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas

    For example: The object (person) in the example below has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.

    ```js
    const person = {
        firstName:"John", 
        lastName:"Doe", 
        age:50, 
        eyeColor:"blue"
        };
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ The typeof Operator

-   You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

    For example:

    ```js
    typeof ""            // Returns "string"
    typeof "John"        // Returns "string"
    typeof "John Doe"    // Returns "string" 
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ  Undefined 

-   In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value `undefined`. The type is also `undefined`.

    ```js
    let car;             // Value is undefined, type is undefined 
    console.log("typeof(car) === ", typeof(car))

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Identifiers

-   Identifiers are JavaScript names.
-   Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
-   The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
-   A JavaScript name must begin with:

    -   A letter (A-Z or a-z)
    -   â€¢ A dollar sign ($)
    -   â€¢ Or an underscore (\_)

-   Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs

    ### Special Note

    Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

    This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript is ALWAYS Case Sensitive

-   All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
-   For example: The variables `lastName` and `lastname`, are two different variables:

    ```js
    let lastname, lastName;
    lastName = "Doe";
    lastname = "Peterson";
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript and Camel Case

-   Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

    ### Hypens - NOT ALLOWED

    first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city

-   Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

    ### Underscore (allowed)

    first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

    ### Upper Camel Case - aka Pascal Case (allowed)

    FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity

    ### Lower Camel Case

    firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity

-   JavaScript programmers tend to use lower camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Character Set

-   JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

-   Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

-   For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Expressions

-   An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
-   The computation is called an evaluation.
-   For example, 5 _ 10 evaluates to 50:
    5 _ 10
-   Expressions can also contain variable values:
    x \* 10
-   The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
    "John" + " " + "Doe"
