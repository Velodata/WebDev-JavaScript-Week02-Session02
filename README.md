# Week 02 - Data Types & Operators

Welcome to Week 02, Wednesday Session 02!

In this lesson, we will cover a fairbit because we didn't get to do Monday's session due to a public Holiday:

In JavaScript, we have different data types. Students must understand these data types. Go
through and teach and explain each data type, especially the concept of the Boolean
argument. 

## 📌 JavaScript Strings

-   A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like **John Doe** 
-   Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes: 
-   Example:

    ```js
    // Using double quotes:
    let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

    // Using single quotes:
    let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';
    ```

-   You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

-   For Example: This next statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

    ```js
    // Single quote inside double quotes:
    let answer1 = "It's alright";

    // Single quotes inside double quotes:
    let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";

    // Double quotes inside single quotes:
    let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';    
    ```


## 📌 JavaScript Numbers

-   All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point).
-   Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
-   For example: The following statements are equivalent in JavaScript:

    ```js
    // With decimals:
    let x1 = 34.00;
    
    // Without decimals:
    let x2 = 34; 
    ```

    A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

    For example:

    ```js
    let x = y + z;
    ```


## 📌 JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

-   For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.  Although with large modern screens nowadays the need to do this is less common.
-   If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

    For example:

    ```js
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Hello Dolly!";
    ```


## 📌 JavaScript Code Blocks

-   JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
-   The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
-   One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
    For example


    ```js
    function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
    }
    ```

## 📌 JavaScript Code Blocks

-   It's quite common for JavaScript statements to start with a keyword which identifies the JavaScript action to be performed.

| Keyword   | Description    |
|-----------|------------------|
| Jvar      |  Declares a variable   |
| let       |  Declares a block variable      |
| const     |  Declares a block constant |
| if        | Marks a block of statements to be executed if a condition is true |
| switch    | Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases |
| for       | Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop |
| function  | Declares a function |
| return    | Exits a function |
| try       | Implements error handling to a block of statements |



## 📌 JavaScript Comments 

-   Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
-   Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
-   Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

    For example:

    ```js
    let x = 5; // I will be executed
    
    // x = 6; I will NOT be executed 

    ```

## 📌 Multi-line Comments

-   Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
-   Multi-line comments happen when we comment out multiple lines of JavaScript.
-   Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
-   This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

    ```js
    /*
    The code below will change
    the heading with id = "myH"
    and the paragraph with id = "myP"
    in my web page:
    */
    document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
    document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
    ```

## 📌 JavaScript Identifiers 

-   Identifiers are JavaScript names.
-   Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
-   The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
-   A JavaScript name must begin with:

    -   A letter (A-Z or a-z)
    -   • A dollar sign ($)
    -   • Or an underscore (_)

-   Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs

    ###  Special Note

    Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

    This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.




## 📌 JavaScript is ALWAYS Case Sensitive

-   All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
-   For example:  The variables `lastName` and `lastname`, are two different variables:

    ```js
    let lastname, lastName;
    lastName = "Doe";
    lastname = "Peterson";
    ```

## 📌 JavaScript and Camel Case

-   Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

    ### Hypens  -  NOT ALLOWED

    first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city

- Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

    ### Underscore  (allowed)

    first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

    ### Upper Camel Case  -  aka Pascal Case  (allowed)

    FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity

    ### Lower Camel Case

    firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity

-   JavaScript programmers tend to use lower camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:



## 📌 JavaScript Character Set

-   JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

-   Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

-   For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.

## 📌 JavaScript Expressions

-   An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
-   The computation is called an evaluation.
-   For example, 5 _ 10 evaluates to 50:
    5 _ 10
-   Expressions can also contain variable values:
    x \* 10
-   The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
    "John" + " " + "Doe"
